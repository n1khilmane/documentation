# EXPERIMENTAL ... EARLY DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS

# bioc-core-sops

This is a site internal to the Bioconductor Core Group. 
It contains information on the group's compuiting infrastructure.

## Platform

The site is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Google's [docsy](https://docsy.dev) theme.

## Installation

You can run the web site locally by following [these instructions](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/).
Note that our site has been setup with the Docsy theme as a Git submodule.

If you would like to avoid installing the Docsy prerequisites on your computer, you can deploy it inside of a Docker container.
To do so, [follow these instructions](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/quickstart-docker/).
*However*, instead of downloading docsy-example, download this repo, `Bioconductor/bioc-core-sops`.
