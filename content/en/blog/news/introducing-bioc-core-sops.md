title: "Introducing Bioconductor Core Team SOPs"
description: 
author: Robert Shear

The Bioconductor Core team relies on a variety of technical resources and services supporting their work. 
These have grown in range and complexity over time, and the knowledge of their location and use is diffuse throughout the team.

As part of the effort to modernize and streamline our cloud resources, we have created this site so that private information can be organized and freely shared important information within the team.

The SOPs in the title should not be taken too literally. We anticipate that much of the useful information on the site will not be in the form of Standard Operating Procedures, but instead reference data, guidelines, and useful but not prescriptive how-tos.

The content is in a [private GitHub repo](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioc-core-sops), with access restricted to team members and others with a bona fide need to know.

We welcome content corrections and additions, reports of flaws in the site, and suggestions for improvement. These may be transmitted as Pull Requests, GitHub Issues, Slack, or email.
